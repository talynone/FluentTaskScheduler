## Overview

FluentTaskScheduler is a professional-grade wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler API, designed with Microsoft's modern Fluent Design System. It simplifies the creation and management of automation tasks, offering a sleek alternative to the legacy Windows Task Scheduler.

## Key Features

### 🕹️ Dashboard & Monitoring

- **Activity Stream**: A live feed of task activity. Click any entry to jump directly to the task details.
- **Task History**: Comprehensive history of all task executions, keeping you informed of every run.

### 🕒 Comprehensive Triggers

- **Time-Based**:
  - **One Time**: Run once at a specific date and time.
  - **Daily**: Recur every X days.
  - **Weekly**: Select specific days of the week (Mon-Sun).
  - **Monthly**: Schedule on specific dates (e.g., 1st, 15th) or relative patterns (e.g., First Monday of the month).
- **System Events**:
  - **At Logon**: Trigger when a user logs in.
  - **At Startup**: Trigger when the system boots.
  - **On Event**: Trigger based on specific Windows Event Log entries (Log, Source, Event ID).
  - **Session State Change**: Trigger on Lock, Unlock, Remote Connect, or Remote Disconnect.
- **Advanced Options**:
  - **Random Delay**: Add a random delay to execution times to prevent thundering herds.
  - **Expiration**: Set task expiration dates.
  - **Stop After**: Automatically stop tasks if they run longer than a specified duration.

### 🔄 Advanced Repetition

- Configure tasks to repeat every few minutes or hours.
- Set a duration for the repetition pattern (e.g., repeat every 15 minutes for 12 hours).

### 📜 Script Library

- **Centralized Management**: A dedicated space for pr-written PowerShell scripts, separating logic from task configuration.
- **Reusable Code**: Use scripts in multiple tasks.

### 🛡️ Actions & Conditions

- **Actions**:
  - Run programs or scripts.
  - Specialized support for **PowerShell** scripts with execution policy bypass tips.
  - Custom working directories and arguments.
- **Conditions**:
  - **Idle**: Start only if the computer has been idle.
  - **Power**: Start only if on AC power; stop if switched to battery.
  - **Network**: Start only if a network connection is available.
  - **Wake to Run**: enhance reliability by waking the computer to execute the task.

### 🎨 Customization

- **Themes**: Standard Dark Mode and specialized **OLED Mode** (Pure Black) for display longevity.
- **Languages**: Native English (en-US) support.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Optional smooth/inertia scrolling throughout the app, disabled by default for a snappier feel.
- **Window Size Memory**: The app remembers your last window size and restores it on next launch.

### 🧬 System Integration

- **System Tray**: Minimize the app to the tray to keep your taskbar clean while the scheduler hums in the background. Disabled by default.
- **Multi-Window Tray Management**: Open multiple windows and manage them independently from the tray right-click menu — restore or close individual windows, or open a new one, all from a single tray icon.
- **Tray Notification**: A toast notification appears the first time the app is minimized to tray, with a click action to restore the window instantly.
- **Single Instance**: Launching the app a second time brings the existing window to the front instead of opening a duplicate.
- **Run on Startup**: Option to launch automatically with Windows.
- **Notifications**: Get native toast notifications when tasks complete or fail.

### ⚙️ Robust Settings

- **Privileges**: Run tasks with highest privileges (Admin) or as System/Specific User.
- **Priority**: Configurable task priority (Realtime to Idle).
- **Concurrency**: Define behavior for multiple instances (Parallel, Queue, Ignore New, Stop Existing).
- **Fail-Safe**:
  - **Restart on Failure**: Automatically attempt to restart failed tasks up to a configured limit.
  - **Run if Missed**: Execute the task as soon as possible if a scheduled start was missed (e.g., computer was off).
- **Settings Backup**: Backup and restore your application settings to ensure your configuration is safe.

### 📊 Management & History

- **Task History**: View recent task execution history within the app (Today, Yesterday, This Week, All Time).
- **Search & Filter**: Instantly find tasks by name, status, or path.
- **Import/Export**: Easily backup or migrate task definitions, including CSV export for history.
- **Batch Operations**: Select and manage multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **CLI Support**: Full command-line interface for automation and headless management.
